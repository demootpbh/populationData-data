Under this concept, a person shall be considered as a resident of the place at which s/he alone (in the case of a one-person household) or with members of her/his household spends most of time, that is, daily rest, irrespective of where the person\u2019s place of residence is registered. Therefore, the total population of a certain place includes persons who lived in that place for a continuous period of at least one year prior to the Census Critical Moment, and persons who at that particular moment lived there less than 12 months but intend to stay at that place for at least one year.","computation_units":"Number","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-10-28","national_data_updated_date":"2025-10-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2025-10-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/demootpbh/populationData-data/commit/4ef3b90982959bc3bebf3d8358d0abf2d3068d66","national_data_update_url_text":"2025-10-28: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/demootpbh/populationData-data/commit/4ef3b90982959bc3bebf3d8358d0abf2d3068d66","indicator":"2.1.3"}
